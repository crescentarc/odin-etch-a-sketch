# odin-etch-a-sketch

Continuing on from the previous Rock Paper Scissors project, this next assignment will have me utilizing the JavaScript I've learned up to this point to create an Etch-A-Sketch on a webpage. Etch-A-Sketches always involve changing colors, so I anticipate that DOM manipulation such as color change to elements under certain conditions will be an even bigger factor than the Rock Paper Scissors game. 

Additionally, the presence of multiple squares in a grid means that I will likely need to make effective use of HTML classes/IDs as well as flexbox to organize them. All in all, it seems that this particular assignment will be the biggest test of the three web development languages I've learned up to this point.
