# odin-etch-a-sketch

Continuing on from the previous Rock Paper Scissors project, this next assignment will have me utilizing the JavaScript I've learned up to this point to create an Etch-A-Sketch on a webpage. Etch-A-Sketches always involve changing colors, so I anticipate that DOM manipulation such as color change to elements under certain conditions will be an even bigger factor than the Rock Paper Scissors game. 

Additionally, the presence of multiple squares in a grid means that I will likely need to make effective use of HTML classes/IDs as well as flexbox to organize them. All in all, it seems that this particular assignment will be the biggest test of the three web development languages I've learned up to this point.

Dec. 24 Update:
Contrary to what I initially thought, what helped me put together the container for the square divs wasn't flexbox, but instead grid. This was the first time I ever used grid in a project and I hope to run into more situation where I can apply it in the future. In addition, I made use of mouse eventlisteners for the first time in order to allow for changing colors in the divs. Finally, I had my first taste of using user input from HTML elements as a variable in functions. In this case, I made it so a range slider input can be used to determine the dimensions of the grid container. Overall, this project turned out to be a good experience in seeing alternative functionality of things I was already familiar with such as eventlisteners.
